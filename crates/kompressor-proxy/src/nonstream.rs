//! The buffered path: forward, and run the retrieve loop over what comes back.
//!
//! The loop is an agent loop with three properties the client never sees:
//!
//! - **The base prompt never changes.** Each round appends the model's turn and
//!   our answers to it, so the provider's cached prefix still covers everything
//!   before the tail.
//! - **The intermediate rounds are hidden.** The client asked for one
//!   completion and gets one completion; it never asked for a tool it does not
//!   know about, and handing it one is how a client ends up reporting
//!   "unsupported call".
//! - **`usage` is the sum.** The client pays for every round, so it is told
//!   about every round. Reporting only the final round would make a
//!   three-round retrieval look like one cheap call, which is the accounting
//!   error that makes a retrieval loop look free when it is not.
//!
//! A failed recovery round returns an error; private tool calls never become
//! a successful client response.

    // A previous version held the last completed round and relayed it when a
    // later one failed, so the client got an answer rather than an error. But
    // the loop only continues past a round when that round asked to retrieve,
    // so the held body *always* contained a `optscale_kompressor_retrieve` call — a tool
    // the client never declared. Handing one over is the failure this design
    // exists to prevent: codex answers `unsupported call: optscale_kompressor_retrieve`,
    // then runs to its output cap building a huge argument string and the next
    // request 400s. It is why `stream_buffer_timeout` ships at 0.
    //
    // So a mid-loop failure is reported as the failure it is. The client sees a
    // provider-shaped error and retries; it does not see a turn it cannot act
    // on.
    //
    // The budget being spent is not an exception to that. An earlier version
    // relayed the round after a refusal whatever it contained, and a model that
    // answered the refusal by calling `optscale_kompressor_retrieve` again put the tool
    // straight into the client's hands — the very failure described above,
    // reached by a different door. Measured against codex: the router answers
    // `unsupported call: optscale_kompressor_retrieve` and the turn is wasted.
    //
    // So a refusal is answered like any other call, and the loop continues. A
    // model that ignores the refusal indefinitely cannot be allowed to spin, so
    // the refusals are counted and the request fails visibly once they run out.
