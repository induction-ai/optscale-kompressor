//! Why the engine did what it did to one payload.
//!
//! This exists because of a specific, repeated waste of operator time. A marker
//! with no handle — `[... 412 matches omitted]` rather than `[... 412 matches
//! omitted [ref:k_AbC123]]` — was read over and over as "recoverable mode is
//! off", and the investigation that followed went looking at configuration.
//! Every time, the mode was on and the elided fragment was simply over
//! `max_ref_bytes`, so there was nothing to point a handle at. Nothing in the
//! output distinguishes the two cases, and nothing could: the marker is the
//! same marker.
//!
//! So this says which one happened, along with everything else that is decided
//! and then thrown away: what the detector called the payload, which compressor
//! that selected, whether the segmenter or whole-message routing won, whether
//! the redraw fold was arbitrated and whether it won, every marker with its
//! handle, and the accounted guard's verdict.
//!
//! Everything here is reconstructed from the engine's public surface rather
//! than instrumented inside it. The pipeline stays free of a reporting mode it
//! would have to keep correct, and the two answers that cannot be observed from
//! outside — which reading won, and whether the fold won — are each derived
//! from a fact that only one branch can produce: only the segmenter reports
//! [`Kind::Mixed`], and only the folded branch emits the redraw marker.
